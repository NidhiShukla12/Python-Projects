
# Q.2 Write a program for assignment operators

# An assignment operator is a symbol used in programming languages to assign a value to a variable. It sets or re-sets the value of a variable to a specified value. The most common assignment operator is the single equals sign (=).

# Assignment operators are used to update the value of a variable, and are a fundamental part of programming languages.

# Assign: a = b
# Add and Assign: a += b
# Subtract and Assign: a -= b
# Multiply and Assign: a *= b
# Divide and Assign: a /= b
# Modulus and Assign: a %= b
# Floor Division and assign: a //= b
# Exponentiation and assign: a **= b

# Add and Assign: a += b

number1 = 10
number2 = 20
number1 += number2
print(number1)

# output will be = 30

# Subtract and Assign: a -= b

number1 = 90
number2 = 20
number1 -= number2
print(number1)

# output will be = 70

# Multiply and Assign: a *= b

number1 = 10
number2 = 20
number1 *= number2
print(number1)

# output will be = 200

# Divide and Assign: a /= b

number1 = 109
number2 = 20
number1 /= number2
print(number1)

# output will be = 5.45

# Modulus and Assign: a %= b

number1 = 109
number2 = 20
number1 %= number2
print(number1)

# output will be = 9


# Floor Division and assign: a //= b

number1 = 110
number2 = 20
number1 //= number2
print(number1)

# output will be = 5

# Exponentiation and assign: a **= b

number1 = 10
number2 = 5
number1 **= number2
print(number1)

# output will be = 100000
